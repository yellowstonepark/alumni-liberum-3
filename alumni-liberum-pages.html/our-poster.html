        <h2>Explaination of poster:</h2>
        <p>The poster that you are seeing below too a lot of thought and effort to think of. And yes, there is one tiny, tiny spelling error in the Copyright - but that doesn't matter much. Right now, I want to talk more about the symbolizism and what's on the poster.</p>
        <p>At the top, you can see the text "Otzar Jaffe" and "Hailey Ahn" in big bold letters. Hailey Ahn is my running mate. To read more about her, click <a href="file:///C:/Otzar%20Projects/Code/Alumni%20Liberum%20Website/alumni-liberum-pages.html/people.html">here.</a> Below that, you will see a picture of the Constitution with a bald eagle over it. The reason why I picked the Constitution as a picture to put on the poster was because the Constitution represents democracy, liberty, and freedom. The reason why I picked the name "Alumni Liberum" for the political party was because it meant free students. Right now, we are free students, students that have power. Ms. Arabachian willing gave up her power, all her power, can gave it to us. But that doesn't mean that we should take advantage of the power, just doing whatever we want. My political party will use that power to improve learning for all students, resolve issues between students by ourselves, lessen screentime, and anything else that would go with our 10 core beliefs.</p>
        <p>Below the picture, you can see the slogan, "If you Pick Otzar for President, it's Evident that He Will be Excellent." This doesn't mean much beyond what is written, but I did take a long time coming up with the catchphrase, so I am proud of it.</p>
        <p>At the very bottom, you can see our core beliefs outlined. My administration and I will do the best job that we can to fulfill those beliefs. We truly want to improve your education during this difficult time and I promise you, we will do whatever it takes for us to get there. I hope that you seeing this website can help assure you that we will keep our promise. If you Pick Otzar for President, Remember that it's Evident that He Will Be Excellent!</p>
