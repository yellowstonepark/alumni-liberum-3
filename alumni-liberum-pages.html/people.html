      <h1 align="center">Mr. Otzar Jaffe - President</h1>
      <p class="textright">The main reason why I'm running for president is because I feel like I can make changes, good changes, that beneift both teachers and students. As your President, I would be the most determined Presdient that you had or will have. When I do something, I commit to it. Take this website for example. It could not have been done without learning at least 3 different programing languages, learning about the OS, learning about browsers -- which all take determination to do. So if you want a President that will get stuff done, and the stuff that they are doing is heavily based on your ideas and feedback, then I'm your guy.</p>

      <h1 align="center">Ms. Hailey Ahn - Vice President</h1>
      <p class="textright">On the first day that I heard that we were doing a government (read more about it under <a href="file:///C:/Otzar%20Projects/Code/Alumni%20Liberum%20Website/alumni-liberum-pages.html/our-goals.html">Goals</a>), I knew that I needed to have Hailey on my team. Hailey so far has been a hard-working team member getting what needs to be done completed. She has worked hard giving me advice on my campaign, and has spent some late nights working with me on something that she wasn't going to get much out of. Thank you Hailey. Hailey will be running as my running mate again, and I am very happy to have her on the team again!</p>

      <h1 align="center">Mr. Ethan Liu - The Head/Main Adivsor</h1>
      <p class="textright">Hayden has been on the team since the very first day. He has also spent a lot of time working with me, giving me ideas, and other various things. He also has stayed up late nights working with me. I really appreciated that. I picked him for the team because of his experience and knowledge of politics, which really helped out team. He is very smart, and very determined to do whatever it takes to improve your education. I also picked Hayden because I feel like he will give me good advice on what to do and what not to do. For example, he advised me on what to wear to my information session, which was really helpful!</p>

      <h1 align="center">Ms. Layla Cruz - Secretary of Defense and Foreign Affairs</h1>
      <p class="textright">When I become President, if I ever get elected, I would need a person to advise me on foreign affairs. It is very important to have good relations with other nations, so that we can have a mutual relationship. It would be unreasonable to start a war with another nation, and would be a giant waste of time. One of my goals as President is to make sure that we have a good relationship with other countries, which can be useful to many reasons such as: creating study guides that we can share between classes, teaming up on unfair policies set up by teachers, and so many various other things that can improve our country and theirs at the same time. </p>

      <h1 align="center">Mr. Zephan Mewengkang - Secretary of Homework, Essay, and Test Mangagement</h1>
      <p class="textright">One of the most controversial topics in many classes is the amount of homework, essays, and tests we should get during this time, when many students are stuggling to keep up with the workload, but when students need to learn as well. I am honored to have Zephan in this position because I feel like he understands the many stuggles students face on a daily basis during remote learning. It is hard to have a balance between the amount of homework we should have (and homework helps us learn) and the amount of homework we shouldn't be having because it would be too much. Zephan will also advise me on tests, and the amount of classwork we should have.</p>
