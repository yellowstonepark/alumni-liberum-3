      <h2>What has the Democratic-Republican Presdient, Mr. Wadia, done and not done?</h2>
      <p>As President, Mr. Waida hasn't done much. Maybe he has done something here and there, but all in all, not much has happened when he was President. He aruges that he has helped students, but he does that on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Here's a little story. After Mr. Wadia got elected, in very late November, our teacher, Ms. Vogel got bumped out of the google meet. Mr. Wadia's Vice President, Uma Pogrebivsky suggested that we stay in the google meet for 5 minutes, and if she still hasn't come back then, then we leave the google meet. Of course, we got into a conversation about the government. During the conversation, Ms. Mina Yeh suggested that we should see how much we can talk advantage of the government (with grades and workload), and see how much we can do until Ms. Arabachain stopped us. This person is his advisor. His advisor was saying that we should take advantage. That's bad. His own advisor is telling him to take advantage.</p>
      <p>Going back to the topic of what Nicholas did as a President, lets look at the main things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The President had his first afterschool meeting on Friday. It was very disorganized. People were talking over each other, some even cursing. Nick tried to solve the issue, but was unable to, and did not take furthur action after the meeting.</li>
        <li>His first executive order was delaying an essay. This can be misleading because I said that he was delaying an essay, which might lead the reader to think that he was taking advantage of the government. In reality, he delayed it to be due after the thanksgiving break, because he wanted us to spend time with our family on thanksgiving instead of doing an essay. I supported this decision.</li>
        <li>The President had his second weekly Friday meeting. It was not as disorganized as the prior meeting, but it still was a little disorganized. Again, students talked over each other because Nick had not devolped a speaking system. However, everyone left happy and joyful after talking and playing games with their friends, so you could call it a part success.</li>
        <li>The President's second executive order was delaying another essay and a vocabulary bank to after the Winter Break. Again, I respected the decision.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="What_has_he_not_done">
        <h5>What has he not done?</h5>
        <ul>
          <h4 class="m">He barely used his advisors. In fact, one even retired.</h4>
          <h5 class="b">I, however, will give my adivsors a chance to shine, letting them give me advice.</h5>
          <h4 class="m">He didn't set a foreign policy.</h4>
          <h5 class="b">I, however, will make sure that have a foreign policy.</h5>
          <h4 class="m">He didn't give any extra credit</h4>
          <h5 class="b">I, however, will make sure that people can get extra credit according to how the Constitution says it can happen.</h5>
          <h4 class="m">He didn't enforce the law of the Legislative Meetings on Fridays, and now we have no laws</h4>
          <h5 class="b">I will make sure that the Legislative Branch will finally make a single law, so that they can activly participate in the government (for them, not me).</h5>
          <h4 class="m">He didn't do a lot more things, but I don't want to go overboard.</h4>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Ilsa">
        <h2>Points against Ilsa's positions:</h2>
        <p>I actually havn't heard anything about her views...so on to the next section.</p>
      </section>
      <h6 align="center">Therefore, Nicholas won't be as good as a President as I can be (again, I don't know about Ilsa, but I think that my determination should be enough for you to vote for me)</h6>
