        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is the student government?</h2>
        <p>In the Class 8G1, Ms. Arabachian gave the students the right and opportunity to create their own student government to solve the various issues in the current classroom. She agreed to follow through with ideas and things the government did even if she strongly disagreed with them. Ms. Arabachian said that she would only stop the government if something inappropriate happened. The student government is outlined <span style="cursor:pointer"><a class="tcl" href="https://www.alumni-liberum.com/constitution.html"></span>in the Constitution that I spent over 50 hours creating and editing</a>. The government is heavily based off of the United States Constitution, but it is edited to fit the needs of a middle school class in a pandemic. The first President was elected on November 19th, 2020. The second President was elected on January 8th, 2021. I hope to be the third President, elected on Febuary 26th, 2021.</p>
        <section id="whoWeAre">
          <h2>What is the Political Party "Alumni Liberum?"</h2>
          <p>The political party "Alumni Liberum" is a political party that was founded when I saw the various issues in the classroom, issues which I believed I could solve. I saw how students were struggling in school learning the material, keeping up with the work, getting through extreme amounts of screen time and struggling to just get through the day. This year has been tough for every student, and my political party recognizes that. I am ready to do anything to improve learning in the classroom. I created this website by learning 3 different and complex programming languages to convey our ideas in a clear and concise way. I created the class Constitution to stop a Constitution packed full of loopholes from being ratified. My party will do whatever it takes (no matter how long it takes) to do what we think is necessary and helpful to learning. The main goal of our party is improving our learning (and overall school) experience. Whether that means study groups, or making a quizizz, we will do it to improve learning. If I am elected President, you can expect my cabinet, my vice president and I to geninually help you and improve your grades on classwork, tests and homework. We will do this numerous ways (discussed later in this section).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How We Will Help With Technology</h2>
          <p>Students and teachers alike are faced with a new way of learning (and teachers are faced with challenges on how to teach in ways that they had never taught before).  For example, a challenge that both students and teachers face is using technonogy that many have never used before. Not only must we use platforms like Google Meet, Google Classroom and Zoom, but in my class, we have to use other various programs, such as Dochub. Since my party is well experienced with technology, we plan to create tutorials on how to use these various programs (which will able to see on both a Google Docs and this website), which we will share with all the teachers.</p>

      <div id="whatWeWillDo">
        <h1>Some Goals I Will Accomplish In Office:</h1>
        <h2><ul><li>Ending Great</li></ul></h2>
        <p>It's the end of the school year. I know, we all hate to admit it. But it's the end. It's the end of our senior year. This means that we need to end the year great. But how can we do this?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sense of Accomplishment</li>
        <p>Going through half, I repeat HALF of middle school during a pandemic is not easy, even for the best of us. We have really accomplished so much. Going through middle school even not during a pandemic is difficult. I will make sure that we will all be pround of ourselves for doing a such a task. As a class, we have been so resilient and haven't stopped trying. And I think that is something to celebrate.</p>
          <li>Legacy</li>
        <p>We really have been a great class. You can just listen to the things that teachers that have been teaching for over 20 years have said about us. We need to end great as well and not slack off at the end of the year. Instead, we should realize about that we have only 2 more months of working hard. We need to be the class who never gave up. That's who we should want to be known as - the class who never gave up. </p>
          <li>Seeing Other G1's</li>
        <p>I will also visit other classes naming in "G1". I will give them some word of advice. I will not only visit these classes. I will try to visit as many classes as I can to also give them advice. Some types of advice I will give them will be about how to cope with stress, how to study for the SHSAT wisely, how to get homework done fast and efficently. I will tell them the mistakes I made so that they won't make them in the future.</p>
          <li>Other Plans</li>
        <p>I have other plans to end great, but you will have to elect me if you want to hear them.</p>
      </ul>
        <section>
          <h2><ul><li>Reducing Stress</li></ul></h2>
          <p>It's the end of the year, yet we are stressing more than ever. My political party will help fix these problems, with the following solutions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Getting Extra Credit</li>
            <p>Together, we will ask for extra credit from teachers. Most classes, we are not given extra credit. If we get one bad grade, it completely ruins our average. This puts a lot of stress on us. We can't mess up once, or we mess up our average. And if we do mess up, it puts even more stress on us. All of our parents expect high scores, some of them even expect 100s in every class. If we have extra credit, it can act as a boost for our grade, kinda removing our mistake and giving us another chance to do better, which my political party fully believes in.</p>
            <li>Creating a study sheet</li>
          <p>On this website, if I become President, you will find all the information that you need to know for the tests. I will write down everything that we go over in class, and write it in language that we can all understand. Everytime you go to this website, you will get an alert at the top (just like the one when you went to this page) that will remind you of the tests coming up. I will also create a section called study sheets. If you would click on that, you would see links to google docs for each class. This can be extremly helpful, because if you have everything on one page, it will also be printable.</p>
            <li>Creating fun activites for you to learn from</li>
          <p>By this I mean that I will encourage teachers to make kahoots and quizizz (or make them myself) to make learning fun and enjoyable. I will also try to have teachers put kids in breakout rooms more often (but you get to pick who you are with) so that we can also learn from our peers. </p>
         </ul>
         <h2><ul><li>Uniting Us All</li></ul></h2>
         <p>We don't need to just unite our class. We need to unite our entire grade to get what we need to end a sucessful year done. Here is how we will achieve unity, not only with our class, but with our grade and our school.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Having a UN call</li>
         <p>We have yet to have a United Nations call between all the nations to dicuss our common values and work towards them. I will collaborate not just with 8th grade nations with a President, but also the ones who didn't have an election. Doesn't matter what class they are. I will work well with all nations. Together, we can do more.</p>
           <li>Visiting Classes</li>
         <p>By this I mean that I will visit 6th and 7th grade classes, or at least contact them. I want to be connected with all students in the school.</p>
         <li>Reopening Committee</li>
       <p>I have been on the Reopening Committee since it opened. It is a school-wide committee that talks about the various problems around the school, and how to solve these problems. The principal, vice principals, and other main staff in our group attend the meeting to listen to us. In this committee, I will continue to advocate for our entire school.</p>
        </ul>
         <h2><ul><li>Ensuring Respect and Resolving Issues</li></ul></h2>
         <p>What "Ensuring Respect and Resolving Issues" means is that I will create policies that will help bring more order to the classroom, and resolve issues. I will also, as the name of this section says, make sure that everyone is respecting and treating each other kindly. Also, if students come to me with an issue betweem them, I will do my best to resolve it, and if I can't, then I will reach out to an adult for help. I mentioned earlier in this paragraph that I would put some policies in place to keep respect and order in the classroom - here they are:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Speaking Policy</li>
           <p>Many people when we are having a discussion love to participate - and that's good. But what's not good is when one person is preventing others from speaking because they are taking too long. As president, I want to make sure that everyone's voice can be heard, even in a classroom with 33 students and limited time. Therefore, I will come up with speaking policies to limit the amount of time someone can talk or respond to something. I will give more information about this during my presidency.</p>
           <li>Participation Policy</li>
           <p>Participation is a big problem for many teachers - they often stuggle trying to get their students to talk in class. My administration will come up with plans for participation where people can get extra credit for an abnomal amount of participation (in a good way, from like never pariticpating to a couple times a week). I will also increase the opportunities for participation so that everyone's voice can be heard, which my administration believes is very important. With that said, we will definitely not force any student to participate if they don't feel comfortable doing so. Instead, we will try to encourage participation with awards, not encourage them with punishments for not participating.</p>
           <li>And many more...</li>
           <p>I have so many great ideas for different policies that we can create, but you'll have to elect me to find out about the rest of them!</p>

          <section id="attendance">
            <ul>
              <li>Attendance Program</li>
              <p>I have created a computer program that will take attendance for me. To plug in the information and figure out who is absent should take me no longer than 30 seconds, even with my slower computer. It will be easier to do on a google meet than a Zoom, so it might take only 20 seconds to do it on a google meet. However, that is much faster and much more efficent that calling out names. After I take the attendance, the teacher will confirm that the people who I said were absent were really absent and then go to pupilpath and fill out the sheet accordingly.</p>
              <li>Reopening Committee</li>
              <p>I have been on the Reopening Committee since it opened. It is a school-wide committee that talks about the various problems around the school, and how to solve these problems. The principal, vice principals, and other main staff in our group attend the meeting to listen to us. In this committee, I will continue to advocate for our entire school.</p>
              <li>Jeopardy</li>
              <p>I studied, created, coded, then hosted a Jeopardy game for the class to play. I have given us a great time during the Jeopardy. Everyone was having a great time playing the Jeopardy in our French class. I look foward to make more Jeopardys in the future. Also, during the last Jeopardy we did, Dominic's and Gabriel's Team won the Jeopardy! They ended up wining the chance to donate a certain amount of money to whatever charity they want. They ended up donating 1,000 toothbrushes to homeless people, all funded by me. This was a big event that I did for the class, and I plan to do many more!!!</p>
              <li>Many more...</li>
              <p>I have done so much for this class, including helping teachers, helping students with homework and so much more. I have tried to be a fun classmate that participates a lot. I hope that everything that I have done makes you think think that I am qaulified to be President!</p>

        <h1>What We Plan to do in Office, weekly (roughly, schedules can change).</h1>
          <section id="Basic Overview of what we want to do while in office">
            <h2>If I get Elected as the Third President of Class 8Genial1:</h2>
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>This will be the first week in which I will be the President of our class. I will give a speech by writing it as a post in the google classroom. After that, I will immediately get to work. To start, I will first implent by attendence system. In this system, I will write a computer program that will allow me to click a button, and have the names of those who are absent right away. After I run the program, I would privately message the teacher which students are absent that day. I will also check in 10 minutes after the Zoom/Google Meet started to see who is late to the class. Finally, if I notice that the amount of people decreased, then I will run the program again to see who left during the middle of the Zoom/Google Meet. This will be a useful system because this will give the teacher more time to teach, and perphahs even make each class shorter. Also, with this system, the teacher won't have to worry about attendence. I will make sure to share the code with all of the teachers so that every teacher can take attendance much faster. This should be extremly helpful for the teacher because they won't have to waste anymore time worry about who is in the class, who left the class, and who was late. It is much harder to keep track of these things, especially in a virtual classroom, where kids can leave without anyone knowing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>This week, I will secure our alliances with all classes and make treaties. I will also try to visit 7G1 and 6G1, giving each class a speech about how things will get better. I will talk to 7G1 during first period, during Ms. Arabachian's french class with them to talk to them about how by the end of the year, they will know French. I know that when I was in 7th and 6th grade, I would have like someone for the former 8G1 to come in and talk to us. I feel like this talk will be much appreciated. To visit the 6th grade, I will email some of the 6th grade teachers that our class had in 6th grade, and ask if they have 6G1. If the teacher has 6G1, and if it's a class that lets us out early, I will make plans with the teacher for me to come in for a few minutes.</p>
            <p>During this week, I will also make sure to secure alliances with other nations and classes around the school. I want to have alliances with at least 5 classes. This week, I will also make my foreign policy. I havn't figured out what foreign policy that we should have, but I am working on it. </p>
            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>During this week, I plan to give out many serveys by google forms to see how they are doing in terms of school, if they are doing well, and what they think of my presidency. This week, I also plan to try to start some clubs afterschool. Like Nicholas, I plan to have Friday sessions for homework and socialization, but I also want to have some clubs. What I will do is send out a servey asking students what clubs they might be interested in joining. I'll also ask teachers if they would be availible for a club, or, if I think the club is not too complicated, I will do it by mysef. During the last presidencal debate, Mr. Greggo said that it's okay if we have things afterschool without a teacher, and if some bullying goes on, we can talk to the kid, but if it continues, we should reach for an adult right away. Therefore, I can have a club without the need of adult supervision.</p>
            <p>I'm sure that I will do more things during this week, but it's too far to plan.</p>
            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <p>This week is a little too far to plan ahead, but I plan to continue what I am doing during the presidency.</p>
            <h3>Week of 5</h3>
            <p>During this week, I plan to wrap up my presidency, get ready for the exchange of power, and so on. I will also give the right of extra credit to the people this week. I will make sure that people can exercise this right that was put in the Bill Of Rights. I will also write a farwell speech and put it in the stream.</p>
